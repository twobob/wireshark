        Stratoshark lets you capture and analyze system call and log data from local and remote sources.
        It has many powerful features including a rich display filter language which lets you quickly drill down to find relevant events.
        You can view detailed information about each event as well as summary views of the entire capture.
    </p>
    <p>
        System call captures are enriched and include detailed information about process activity, including user IDs, file names, and container names.
