<!-- Any files added here need to be added to
     packaging/nsis/custom_diameter_xmls.txt to be distributed -->
<!-- The purpose of this file is to allow custom entries to the
     Diameter dictionary to be added by editing this one file and
     not the main file (which might make it easier to manage updates).
     The main dictionary always adds the &Custom; entity, which by
     default is declared below as an empty string.
-->
<!-- To populate the Custom entity with entries, create entities like this:
        <!ENTITY myEntity		SYSTEM "myFile.xml">
     either with an external file as above or strings directly in this
     file and then add the entities to the value of the Custom entity, e.g.
     replacing the empty string below like so:
        <!ENTITY Custom "&myEntity;">
     Note that if the same entity is declared more than once, the
     first declaration is binding, according to the XML specification.
     To add more than one custom entity, add them all to the Custom
     value in a single declaration:
        <!ENTITY myEntity2		SYSTEM "myFile2.xml">
        <!ENTITY Custom "&myEntity; &myEntity2;">
-->
<!ENTITY Custom "">
