 * Dissector use and management
 *
 *  Consider a collection of tvbs as being a chain or stack of tvbs.
 *
 *  When dissecting a frame:
 *   The top-level dissector (packet.c) pushes the initial tvb (containing
 *   the complete frame) onto the stack (starts the chain) and then calls
 *   a sub-dissector which in turn calls the next sub-dissector and so on.
 *   Each sub-dissector may chain additional tvbs (see below) to the tvb
 *   handed to that dissector. After dissection is complete and control has
 *   returned to the top-level dissector, the chain of tvbs (stack) is free'd
 *   via a call to tvb_free_chain() (in epan_dissect_cleanup()).
 *
 * A dissector:
 *  - Can chain new tvbs (subset, real, composite) to the
 *    tvb handed to the dissector using tvb_new_subset_length_caplen(),
 *    tvb_new_subset_length(), tvb_new_subset_remaining(),
 *    tvb_new_child_real_data(), tvb_set_child_real_data_tvbuff(),
 *    tvb_composite_finalize(), and tvb_child_uncompress(). (Composite
 *    tvbs should reference only tvbs which are already part of the chain).
 *  - Must not save for later use (e.g., when dissecting another frame) a
 *    pointer to a tvb handed to the dissector; (A higher level function
 *    may very well free the chain thus leaving a dangling pointer).
 *    This (obviously) also applies to any tvbs chained to the tvb handed
 *    to the dissector.
 *  - Can create its own tvb chain (using tvb_new_real_data() which the
 *    dissector is free to manage as desired.

 *
 * Extracts BCD-encoded digits from the given @ref tvbuff_t starting at `offset` and spanning
 * `len` bytes (or to the end if `len` is -1). Each byte contains two nibbles representing digits.
 * The conversion behavior is controlled by `skip_first`, `odd`, and `bigendian` flags:
 *
 * - If `skip_first` is true, the first nibble (high-order) of the first byte is ignored.
 * - If `odd` is true, the high-order nibble of the last byte is skipped.
 * - If `bigendian` is true, each byte is interpreted with the high-order nibble as the first digit
 *   and the low-order nibble as the second digit; otherwise, the order is reversed.
 *
 * Digits are formatted using the provided digit set `dgt`. If `dgt` is NULL, a default digit set
 * of '0'â€“'9' is used, and any overdecadic values (10â€“15) are rendered as '?'.
 *
