== DESCRIPTION

*Stratoshark* is a GUI system call and log analyzer.
It lets you interactively browse system calls and log messages from a live system or from a previously saved capture file.
*Stratoshark*'s native capture file format is *scap*, which is used by the sysdig CLI tool and by Falco.

// *Stratoshark* can also read / import the following file formats:

// * Android Logcat binary and text format logs

// *  _systemd_ journal files

*Stratoshark*'s main window shows 3 views of each event.
It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the event is.
An event details display is shown, allowing you to drill down to exact field that you interested in.
Finally, a hex dump shows you exactly what the event data looks like on disk or over the wire.

In addition, *Stratoshark* has some features that make it unique.
It can assemble all the syscalls in a file descriptor stream and show you the ASCII (or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.
Display filters in *Stratoshark* are very powerful; more fields are filterable in *Stratoshark* than in other tools, and the syntax you can use to create your filters is richer.
As *Stratoshark* progresses, expect more and more fields to be supported.

Event capturing is performed by the libscap and libsinsp libraries.
The capture filter syntax follows the rules of the libscap.
This syntax is different from the display filter syntax.

Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, *Stratoshark* will compile, but will be unable to read compressed files.

The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
*-r* option or can be specified as a command-line argument.

== OPTIONS

*Stratoshark* supports a wide variety of command line options.
Most users will want to start it without any options and configure it from the application menus instead.
Those users may wish to skip this section.

-a|--autostop  <capture autostop condition>::
+
--
Specify a criterion that specifies when *Stratoshark* should stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form __test:value__,
where __test__ is one of:

*duration*:__value__ Stop writing to a capture file after __value__ seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

*files*:__value__ Stop writing to capture files after __value__ number of files
were written.

*filesize*:__value__ Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
__value__ kB.  If this option is used together with the -b option, Stratoshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 TB, although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of events exceeds 2^31^ (2147483648).

*events*:__value__ Stop writing to a capture file after it contains __value__ events.
Acts the same as *-c*<capture event count>.
--

-b|--ring-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>::
+
--
Cause *Stratoshark* to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
*Stratoshark* will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, *Stratoshark* will switch writing to the next file and so on.

The created filenames are based on the filename given with the *-w* flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, ...

With the __files__ option it's also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point *Stratoshark* will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the __files__ option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).

The criterion is of the form __key:value__,
where __key__ is one of:

*duration*:__value__ switch to the next file after __value__ seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

*files*:__value__ begin again with the first file after __value__ number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The *files* criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each *-b*
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the *-b* option.

*filesize*:__value__ switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
__value__ kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of events exceeds 2^31^ (2147483648).

*interval*:__value__ switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of __value__ seconds.

*events*:__value__ switch to the next file after it contains __value__ events.

Example: *-b filesize:1000 -b files:5* results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.
--

-c  <capture event count>::
Set the maximum number of events to read when capturing live
data. Acts the same as *-a events:*<capture event count>.

-C  <configuration profile>::
Start with the given configuration profile.

--capture-comment <comment>::
+
--
When performing a capture file from the command line, with the *-k*
flag, add a capture comment to the output file, if supported by the
capture format.

This option may be specified multiple times.  Note that Stratoshark
currently only displays the first comment of a capture file.
--

-D|--list-sources::
Print a list of the sources from which *Stratoshark* can capture, and exit.
For each source, a number and a source name, possibly followed by a text description of the source, is printed.
The source name or the number can be supplied to the *-i* flag to specify a source from which to capture.

--display <X display to use>::
Specifies the X display to use.  A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0)
or just a screen (:0.0) can be specified.  This option is not available
under macOS or Windows.

-f  <capture filter>::
+
--
Set the capture filter expression.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the source specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.

Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture->Capture Filters,
can be used by prefixing the argument with "predef:".
Example: *-f "predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter"*
--

////
-F  <file format>::
When performing a capture file from the command line, with the *-k* option,
set the file format of the output capture file written using the *-w* option.
In situations that require the *pcapng* format, such as capturing from
multiple interfaces, this option will be overridden. The option *-F*
without a value will list the available formats. The default is the
*pcapng* format (unless the default has been changed in preferences.)

This does not support every format to which Stratoshark can convert a file;
this is intentional for security reasons. Capture in a supported format and
then save the file in a different format if so desired.
////

--fullscreen::
+
--
Start Stratoshark in full screen mode (kiosk mode). To exit from fullscreen mode,
open the View menu and select the Full Screen option. Alternatively, press the
F11 key (or Ctrl + Cmd + F for macOS).
--

-g  <event number>::
After reading in a capture file using the *-r* flag, go to the given __event number__.

-h|--help::
Print the version number and options and exit.

-H::
Hide the capture info dialog during live capture.

-i|--source  <capture source>|-::
+
--
Set the name of the capture source or pipe to use for live capture.

Capture source names should match one of the names or numbers listed in "*stratoshark -D*" (described above).

If no source is specified, *Stratoshark* searches the list of sources, choosing the first source.
If there are no sources at all, *Stratoshark* reports an error and doesn't start the capture.

Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form +"\\.\pipe\+*pipename*".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard scap format.
Scap data must have the same endianness as the capturing host.

This option can occur multiple times.
--

-j::
Use after *-J* to change the behavior when no exact match is found for
the filter.  With this option select the first event before.

-J  <jump filter>::
+
--
After reading in a capture file using the *-r* flag, jump to the event
matching the filter (display filter syntax).  If no exact match is found
the first event after that is selected.
--

-k::
+
--
Start the capture session immediately.  If the *-i* flag was
specified, the capture uses the specified source.  Otherwise,
*Stratoshark* searches the list of sources and uses the first source.
If there are no sources, *Stratoshark* reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
--

-l::
Turn on automatic scrolling if the event display is being updated
automatically as events arrive during a capture (as specified by the
*-S* flag).

-L|--list-data-link-types::
List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.

--list-time-stamp-types::
List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be
set, no time stamp types are listed.

-o  <preference/recent setting>::
+
--
Set a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value
read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the flag is a string of
the form __prefname:value__, where __prefname__ is the name of the
preference/recent value (which is the same name that would appear in the
preference/recent file), and __value__ is the value to which it should be set.

If __prefname__ is "uat", you can override settings in various user access
tables using the form "uat:__uat filename__:__uat record__".  __uat filename__
must be the name of a UAT file, e.g. __user_dlts__.  __uat_record__ must be in
the form of a valid record for that file, including quotes.  For instance, to
specify a user DLT from the command line, you would use

    -o "uat:user_dlts:\"User 0 (DLT=147)\",\"cops\",\"0\",\"\",\"0\",\"\""
--

-P <path setting>::
+
--
Special path settings usually detected automatically.  This is used for
special cases, e.g. starting Stratoshark from a known location on an USB stick.

The criterion is of the form __key:path__, where __key__ is one of:

*persconf*:__path__ path of personal configuration files, like the
preferences files.

*persdata*:__path__ path of personal data files, it's the folder initially
opened.  After the very first initialization, the recent file will keep the
folder last used.
--

-r|--read-file  <infile>::
Read event data from __infile__, can be any supported capture file format
(including compressed files).  It's not possible to use named pipes or stdin
here, unlike *TShark*! To capture from a pipe or from stdin use *-i -*.

-R|--read-filter  <read (display) filter>::
When reading a capture file specified with the *-r* flag, causes the
specified filter (which uses the syntax of display filters, rather than
that of capture filters) to be applied to all events read from the
capture file; events not matching the filter are discarded.


-S::
Automatically update the event display as events are coming in.

--temp-dir <directory>::
+
--
Specifies the directory into which temporary files (including capture
files) are to be written.  The default behavior on UNIX-compatible systems,
such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, is to use the environment
variable __$TMPDIR__ if set, and the system default, typically __/tmp__, if it
is not.  On Windows, the __%TEMP%__ environment variable is used, which
typically defaults to __%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp__.
--

--time-stamp-type <type>::
Change the sources's timestamp method. See --list-time-stamp-types.

--update-interval  <interval>::
Set the length of time in milliseconds between new event reports during
a capture. Also sets the granularity of file duration conditions.
The default value is 100ms.

-v|--version::
Print the full version information and exit.

-w  <outfile>::
Set the default capture file name, or '-' for standard output.

-X <eXtension options>::
+
--
Specify an option to be passed to an *Stratoshark* module.  The eXtension option
is in the form __extension_key:value__, where __extension_key__ can be:

*lua_script*:__lua_script_filename__ tells *Stratoshark* to load the given script in addition to the
default Lua scripts.

**lua_script**__num__:__argument__ tells *Stratoshark* to pass the given argument
to the lua script identified by 'num', which is the number indexed order of the 'lua_script' command.
For example, if only one script was loaded with '-X lua_script:my.lua', then '-X lua_script1:foo'
will pass the string 'foo' to the 'my.lua' script.  If two scripts were loaded, such as '-X lua_script:my.lua'
and '-X lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '-X lua_script2:bar' would pass the string 'bar' to the second lua
script, namely 'other.lua'.

////
*read_format*:__file_format__ tells *Stratoshark* to use the given file format to read in the
file (the file given in the *-r* command option).
////

*stdin_descr*:__description__ tells *Stratoshark* to use the given description when
capturing from standard input (*-i -*).
--

////
-y|--linktype  <capture link type>::
+
--
If a capture is started from the command line with *-k*, set the data
link type to use while capturing events.  The values reported by *-L*
are the values that can be used.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the *-i* option, it sets the default capture link type.
If used after an *-i* option, it sets the capture link type for
the source specified by the last *-i* option occurring before
this option.  If the capture link type is not set specifically,
the default capture link type is used if provided.
--
////

-Y|--display-filter  <displaY filter>::
Start with the given display filter.

-z  <statistics>::
+
--
Get *Stratoshark* to collect various types of statistics and display the result
in a window that updates in semi-real time.

Some of the currently implemented statistics are:
--

*-z help*::
Display all possible values for *-z*.

////
*-z* afp,srt[,__filter__]::
+
--
Show Apple Filing Protocol service response time statistics.
--

*-z* conv,__type__[,__filter__]::
+
--
Create a table that lists all conversations that could be seen in the
capture.  __type__ specifies the conversation endpoint types for which we
want to generate the statistics; currently the supported ones are:

  "eth"   Ethernet addresses
  "fc"    Fibre Channel addresses
  "fddi"  FDDI addresses
  "ip"    IPv4 addresses
  "ipv6"  IPv6 addresses
  "ipx"   IPX addresses
  "tcp"   TCP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
  "tr"    Token Ring addresses
  "udp"   UDP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

If the optional __filter__ is specified, only those events that match the
filter will be used in the calculations.

The table is presented with one line for each conversation and displays
the number of events/bytes in each direction as well as the total
number of events/bytes.  By default, the table is sorted according to
the total number of events.

These tables can also be generated at runtime by selecting the appropriate
conversation type from the menu "Tools/Statistics/Conversation List/".
--

*-z* dcerpc,srt,__name-or-uuid__,__major__.__minor__[,__filter__]::
+
--
Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for DCERPC interface
__name__ or __uuid__, version __major__.__minor__.
Data collected is the number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT
and AvgSRT.
Interface __name__ and __uuid__ are case-insensitive.

all Transaction2 commands and all NT Transaction commands.
Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have their stats
displayed.
Only the first command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation.  So for common SessionSetupAndX + TreeConnectAndX chains,
only the SessionSetupAndX call will be used in the statistics.
This is a flaw that might be fixed in the future.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional __filter__ is provided, the stats will only be calculated

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

// Should this be moved to an include file?

WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR::
+
--
This environment variable overrides the location of personal
configuration files.  On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to __$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark__
(or, if that directory doesn't exist but __$HOME/.wireshark__ does
exist, __$HOME/.wireshark__); this is typically
__$HOME/.config/wireshark__.  On Windows, it defaults to
__%APPDATA%\Wireshark__ (or, if %APPDATA% isn't defined,
__%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark__).  Available since
Wireshark 3.0.
--

WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE::
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for *all* allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See __README.wmem__ in the source distribution for
details.

WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY::
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather
than from the standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible
systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.

WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.

WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR::
This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.

WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG::
If this environment variable is set, *Stratoshark* will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running *Stratoshark* in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.

WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS::
If this environment variable is set, *Stratoshark* will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
*Stratoshark* in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.

WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE::
Cause *Stratoshark* to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn't automatically start a capture; you must still use *-k* to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  *-c* or *-a
duration:...*.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it's primarily useful for testing.

WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL::
This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be `critical`,
`warning`, `message`, `info`, `debug` or `noisy`. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels `critical` and `error` are always
active.

WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL::
Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to `Error`, `critical` or `warning`. `Error` is
always fatal and is the default.

WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS::
This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the sense of the match.

WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG::
List of domains with `debug` log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by '!' this disables the `debug` level instead.

WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY::
Same as above but for `noisy` log level instead.
