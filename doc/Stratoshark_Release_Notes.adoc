= Stratoshark {stratoshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Stratoshark 1.0.

== What is Stratoshark?

Stratoshark is a system call and log analyzer.
It combines the analysis and filtering features of Wireshark with the capture and data enrichment features of https://falco.org[Falco].
It can be used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

Stratoshark is hosted by the Wireshark Foundation, a nonprofit which promotes protocol and system analysis education.
Stratoshark and the foundation depend on your contributions in order to do their work.
If you or your organization would like to contribute or become a sponsor, please visit https://wiresharkfoundation.org[wiresharkfoundation.org].
