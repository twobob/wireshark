= Stratoshark Quick Start

Stratoshark is a sibling application for Wireshark which focuses on system calls and log messages.
It helps people understand, troubleshoot, and secure their systems via system calls and log messages similar to the way Wireshark helps people understand, troubleshoot, and secure their networks via packets.

This document provides brief instructions for obtaining, using, and building Stratoshark until more complete documentation https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20303[comparable to the Wireshark Developer’s and User’s Guides can be written].

== Getting Stratoshark

You can get Windows and macOS development packages from https://stratoshark.org/.
Native system call captures aren't yet supported on those platforms, but they do come with the https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/main/plugins/cloudtrail/README.md[CloudTrail plugin], which can pull AWS CloudTrail logs from an S3 bucket or SQS/SNS.

If you wish to use Stratoshark on Linux you will have to built it yourself.
Instructions for doing that can be found in the <<building_stratoshark,Building Stratoshark>> section below.

== Using Stratoshark

Stratoshark shares a great deal of code with Wireshark, including most of its UI elements.
If you are familiar with Wireshark, its interface and workflows should be familiar.

One issue that you might run into initially is that system calls and logs deal with different information.
As a result, the event list column preferences and coloring rules need to be configured to match the kind of data that you are analyzing.
Stratoshark's default configuration profile assumes that you are analyzing system calls.
It ships with a "CloudTrail" configuration profile which is geared toward CloudTrail events.
You can find more information on working with configuration profiles in the https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustConfigProfilesSection.html[Configuration Profiles] section in the Wireshark User's Guide.
If you switch back and forth between system call and CloudTrail captures on a regular basis, you might find the "Automatic Profile Switching" feature useful.

You can obtain system call captures using the https://github.com/draios/sysdig[sysdig command line tool] or by using Stratoshark on a Linux system.
Stratoshark ships with the following capture sources:

https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/blob/master/doc/man_pages/falcodump.adoc[Falcodump]:: Allows capturing logs from a variety of sources using Falco plugins.

https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/blob/master/doc/man_pages/dumpcalls.adoc[Dumpcalls]:: Allows capturing local system calls on Linux.

https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/blob/master/doc/man_pages/sshdig.adoc[Sshdig]:: Allows system call capture from remote systems using sysdig over SSH.

== Building Stratoshark[[building_stratoshark]]

Stratoshark requires the same build environment as Wireshark.
See the https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/[Wireshark Developer’s Guide] for instructions on setting that up.

It additionally requires libsinsp and libscap from https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/[falcosecurity/libs] and any desired plugins from https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/[falcosecurity/plugins].

In order to build Stratoshark, do the following:

1. https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/source/[Build falcosecurity/libs].

2. Build any desired https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/[Falco plugins] and copy them somewhere, such as `/usr/local/lib/falcosecurity/plugins`.

3. Build the Wireshark sources with the following CMake options:
+
--
[horizontal]
BUILD_stratoshark:: Must be enabled, e.g. set to ON.
BUILD_falcodump:: Must be enabled for Falco plugin capture.
BUILD_dumpcalls:: Must be enabled for local capture on Linux.
BUILD_sshdig:: Must be enabled for remote capture over SSH.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:: If you installed libsinsp and libscap to a non-standard directory, https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html[this should point there].
FALCO_PLUGINS:: Semicolon-separated paths to individual Falco plugins, e.g. `/path/to/libcloudtrail.so`.
--

.Example 1: Building on Linux using Make
[sh]
----
# This assumes that falcosecurity-libs and the CloudTrail plugin were installed in
# `/opt/falco-libs/0.18.1`.
cmake \
  -DBUILD_stratoshark=ON \
  -DBUILD_falcodump=ON \
  -DBUILD_dumpcalls=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/falco-libs/0.18.1 \
  -DFALCO_PLUGINS=/opt/falco-libs/0.18.1/lib/falcosecurity/plugins/libcloudtrail.so \
  ..
make -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
----

If you want to add other Falco plugins later you can copy them to a `falco` subfolder in the Global Plugins folder. The path to the Global Plugins folder is shown in the "Folders" tab in the "About Stratoshark" dialog.

== Falco Plugin Recommendations

Falco plugins may not return field offset information, which means that they won't be highlighted properly in the byte or text view panes in Stratoshark.
In order to support offsets, plugins must check for the request_offsets member of the ss_plugin_field_extract_input and set the start offset and length as follows:

  - 0,0: Indicates that the field doesn't have single, valid start and end values, e.g. it's generated from other data.
  - <start>,<length>: Each value must be a zero-indexed offset value from the start of the event or log data and the data length.
