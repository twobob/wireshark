== Debugging Symbols for Stratoshark

This archive contains the debugging symbols for Stratoshark {stratoshark-version}.
The debugging symbols are only necessary if Stratoshark is crashing and you need to report an issue to the Stratoshark development team.

WARNING: This won't work properly with any version other than Stratoshark {stratoshark-version}.

To install the symbols, drag _Stratoshark.dSYM_ to the same location as _Stratoshark.
This is usually your _Applications_ folder.

To uninstall, drag _Stratoshark.dSYM_ to the trash.
